# ExploringTheFourierTransformation
Lab #3 from my CSC 222 Data Structures &amp; Algorithms II class.

Installing:
=======

Clone it:

`$ git clone git@github.com:g12mcgov/ExploringTheFourierTransformation.git`

Run the install script to install modules:

`$ sudo python setup.py install`

<b>Note:</b> If working inside a virtual environment (which you should be), you may have to manually install `numpy` if it fails with setup tools. This is setup tools bug. To do this, just run:

`$ sudo pip install numpy`

Running:
=======

`$ python lab3.py`
