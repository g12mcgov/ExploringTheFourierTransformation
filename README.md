# ExploringTheFourierTransformation
[Lab #3](https://github.com/g12mcgov/ExploringTheFourierTransformation/blob/master/notes/Lab3.pdf) from my CSC 222 Data Structures &amp; Algorithms II class.

Installing:
=======

Clone it:

`$ git clone git@github.com:g12mcgov/ExploringTheFourierTransformation.git`

Run the install script to install modules:

`$ sudo python setup.py install`

<b>Note:</b> If working inside a virtual environment (which you should be), you may have to manually install `numpy` if it fails with setup tools. This is setup tools bug. To do this, just run:

`$ sudo pip install numpy`

Running:
=======

To run, simply execute the following:

`$ python lab3.py`

If you would like to run it and output the graphs as well, add the following argument:

`$ python lab3.py -g graph`
